# Network-Port-Scanner-Project
A python network port scanner created as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.


## Description
This project is a simple port scanner written in Python. It allows users to scan a specified IP address for open ports, demonstrating basic network security concepts and Python programming skills. This project aligns with my studies in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University, applying concepts from courses like Fundamentals of Information Security as well as Network and Security-Foundations.

## Features
- Scans a range of ports on a specified IP address
- Identifies open ports
- Provides a user-friendly command-line interface
- Implements error handling for various network issues

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the script: `python port_scanner.py <ip_address>`
3. The script will display open ports on the specified IP address

## What I Learned
- Basic networking concepts
- Socket programming in Python
- Error handling in network applications
- Command-line argument parsing
- Displaying time output in a 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator
